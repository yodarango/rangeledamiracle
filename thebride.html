  <h1 id="storyBrideGroom">OUR STORY</h1>

  <p id="storyBrideGroomP" class="storyBrideGroomP">Daniel and Alayna met June 19, 
      2019 in Covington, KY. The second service of General Ministries Conference 
      was a bilingual service that Daniel was translating. 
      They only lived two hours apart but had to travel twice that distance in order to meet. 
      Thankfully, Alayna remembered two sentences from her high school Spanish class
    that she used to break the ice. Their love continued to grow and Daniel purposed 
    on April 25, 2020. They will live their first couple years as a married couple in Spartanburg, SC 
    and then relocate back to Tennessee. Thank you for taking interest in their story!</p>
